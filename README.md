## What is bbpackage?

BBEdit is a fantastic text editor for OS X. It's rock-solid, well-designed, and its project-wide search functionality is one of the best implementations I've come across. I much prefer it to alternative editors such as [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Chocolat](https://chocolatapp.com/).

Unfortunately, BBEdit lags behind other editors when it comes to available plugins. BBEdit provides support for creating and sharing "packages," but no centralized mechanism by which these packages can easily be found and installed has existed... until now.

## Installing BBPackage

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

```
$ sudo npm install -g bbpackage
```

That's it. You're done.

## Searching for Packages

```
$ bbpackage search jshint
```

## Installing a Package

```
$ bbpackage install jshint
```

## Uninstalling a Package

```
$ bbpackage uninstall jshint
```

## Registering a Package

The `bbpackage` utility works similarly to [Bower](http://bower.io/), if you're familiar with that. Packages are registered on a first-come, first-serve basis, and must be available on GitHub. The following example illustrates how you would go about registering a new package:

```
$ bbpackage register jshint https://github.com/tkambler/bbedit-jshint
```

## Package Format

To understand how to go about creating your own packages, it would be best to look at an actual example:

[jshint](https://github.com/tkambler/bbedit-jshint)

The [BBEdit documentation](http://pine.barebones.com/manual/BBEdit_10_User_Manual.pdf) defines a format that packages should follow (see the "Language Modules and Packages" chapter), and that is exactly what bbpackage expects, with one optional addition:

If you are familiar with Node.js and prefer to write your packages within that framework (like I do), within your package's `Contents` folder, you can create a `package.json` file. If this file exists, bbpackage will automatically install any defined dependencies when your package is installed.
